**Loan Approval Prediction**

Welcome to the Loan Approval Prediction project, a part of our final year research initiative. The primary goal of this project is to explore and apply research-driven techniques to build a real-world solution for the loan approval process.

By leveraging cutting-edge data science methods and machine learning algorithms, we aimed to develop a system that can predict loan approvals with high accuracy, helping banks and financial institutions make faster and more reliable decisions. 

Used Technologies:
1. Angular
2. Spring Boot
3. Flask API
4. Google Colab

Key Highlights:
Research-Based Approach: The project is rooted in extensive research to understand the intricacies of loan approval systems and identify the best predictive models.
Data Preprocessing: Google Colab was used to preprocess the data, ensuring that the dataset was clean, structured, and ready for model training.
Model Selection: Multiple machine learning models were tested, with LightGBM emerging as the fastest and most accurate model for loan approval predictions, achieving over 95% accuracy.
Real-Life Impact: This system aims to improve loan approval processes, making them faster and more efficient, thereby contributing to better decision-making in the financial industry.
